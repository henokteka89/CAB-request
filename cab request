CAB Request: Implementation of Parameterized SQL Queries

Requester: 
Date:  

Summary
We propose shifting from direct string SQL queries to parameterized queries across our applications to address CPU and memory pressures, which degrade system performance.
Issue
Non-parameterized SQL queries cause:
•	High CPU utilization due to frequent compilations.
•	Memory pressure from caching multiple plans for similar queries.
Proposal
Mandatory use of parameterized SQL queries for all database interactions.
Update existing queries and enforce through code reviews.
 Benefits
•	Reduced CPU and memory usage.
•	Improved system performance and scalability.
•	Enhanced security against SQL injection.
Impact
Short-term development overhead in updating queries. Long-term benefits include lower operational costs, improved performance, and enhanced security.
Action Requested
Approval to enforce parameterized queries, ensuring better resource management and system reliability. 
Attached are frequently utilized strings by the application that require parameterization or conversion into stored procedures.
